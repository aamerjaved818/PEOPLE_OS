## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 2: Codebase Standardization (100% Complete)

- [x] **Linting**: 0 ESLint errors/warnings.
- [x] **Formatting**: Prettier check passed.
- [x] **Type Safety**: strict `tsconfig.json`, 0 TypeScript errors.
- [x] **Critical Fixes**: Blank screen resolved, Branding updated.
- [x] **Environment**: Dev @ 8080, Preview @ 4040.
- [x] **Result**: Stable, clean codebase ready for feature work.

### Phase 3: Security & Error Handling (100% Complete)

- [x] **Error Handling**: Global React Error Boundary.
- [x] **Sanitization**: Input validation via `utils/security.ts`.
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: API throttling utilities.
- [x] **Audit Logs**: Verified logging structure.

### Phase 4: Backend Restoration & Integration

- [ ] **Backend Recovery**: Restore the missing Python/FastAPI backend.
  - _Critical_: The frontend currently mocks data or points to a non-existent server.
- [ ] **API Verification**: Validate `services/api.ts` against the live backend.

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization

- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Implement `React.lazy` for all major modules (Attendance, Reports).
- [ ] **Bundle Analysis**: Optimize vendor chunks.

### Phase 6: Full E2E Testing

- [ ] **Playwright/Cypress**: Implement end-to-end user flow tests.

## 📋 Immediate Action Items (Today)

1.  Run `npm run type-check` to generate the current error report.
2.  Begin fixing "High Priority" TypeScript errors in `modules/Neural.tsx`.
