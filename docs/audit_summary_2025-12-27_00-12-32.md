# HCM Web Project Audit Summary

Date: 2025-12-27 00:12:32

The HCM web project is a modern React 19 application with a sophisticated "Enterprise OS" design. While the UI is impressive, the underlying architecture suffers from monolithic module files and a lack of global state management. AI integration is present but uses outdated model references. Key features like global search are currently non-functional. The proposed plan focuses on refactoring, componentization, and functional enhancements to build a scalable foundation.
