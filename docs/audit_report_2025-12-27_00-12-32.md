# HRMS Web Project Audit Report

Date: 2025-12-27 00:12:32

### 1. Architecture & Structure

- **Modular but Monolithic**: The project uses a modular structure (`/modules`), but each module is a single large file (e.g., `Employee.tsx` is 49KB). This makes maintenance and testing difficult.
- **State Management**: Relies heavily on local component state and `localStorage`. No global state management (Redux/Zustand) is implemented, leading to prop drilling or redundant state.
- **Hardcoded Data**: Most modules contain large amounts of hardcoded mock data, which should be moved to a service or data layer.
- **Code Splitting**: No evidence of dynamic imports or code splitting for modules, which could impact initial load time as the project grows.

### 2. Code Quality & Tech Stack

- **Modern Stack**: Excellent use of React 19, Vite 6, and TypeScript 5.8.
- **Type Safety**: Good use of TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts`, though some components could benefit from stricter typing.
- **Styling**: Consistent use of Tailwind CSS. However, there's a lack of a centralized UI component library, leading to repeated styling patterns.

### 3. AI Integration

- **Gemini Service**: Integrated via `@google/genai`.
- **Outdated Models**: `geminiService.ts` references `gemini-3-pro-preview`, which may not be the optimal or current model name (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro` or `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`).
- **Prompting**: Prompts are basic and could be optimized for better HR-specific insights.

### 4. UI/UX & Design

- **Aesthetics**: High-quality, modern "Enterprise OS" aesthetic with dark mode support.
- **Non-functional Features**: Global search and some action buttons (e.g., "Acknowledge All") are UI-only and lack implementation.
- **Responsiveness**: Basic responsiveness is present, but complex modules may need more work for smaller screens.
