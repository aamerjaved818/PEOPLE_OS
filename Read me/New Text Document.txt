why you are still failing to fix it, grid data area shows under sidebar on startup, after refreshing becomes normal.

Setup E2E Testing Infrastructure (Playwright)

enhance the Dashboard with beautiful hovering effects.

Deployment & Automation
New Setup: Run npm run setup to initialize everything automatically.
New Commands: npm run start:all, npm run dev, npm run build (Replaced all .bat files).

Login Experience Upgraded

I have successfully fine-tuned the login screen with a premium, glassmorphic design.

make central theme premium, apply it to project and verify.

Enhancements:

Visuals: Added a dynamic background with subtle animations and a "frosted glass" card effect.
Interactions: Improved input focus states and added a smooth "verifying" animation on the button.
Success State: Added a satisfying "Access Granted" confirmation before redirecting.

i think all data showing in access control is fixed/hardcoded/initial/constant.
