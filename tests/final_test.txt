Invalid value for prop `icon` on <input> tag. Either remove it from the element, or pass a string or number value to keep it in the DOM. For details, see https://react.dev/link/attribute-behavior 
React does not recognize the `isLoading` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `isloading` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.
